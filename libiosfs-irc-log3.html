	<pygi>	uh, don't apologize pls phoenix24 :)
	<andrew____>	hello
	[ERROR]	You need to be an operator in #libburn to do that.
	<phoenix24>	hi andrew____
	<pygi>	hello BKandrew ^_^
	<andrew____>	:)
	<pygi>	you saw my comment? :)
	<andrew____>	i really have to get off my ass and make a webpage for the library
	<andrew____>	yes, it was nice ty
	<phoenix24>	btw, why is it called libburnia ?
	<pygi>	andrew____, I'll help ya, we'll talk over mail about that
	<pygi>	phoenix24, For the origin of this name, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liburnians
	<pygi>	and note I'm from Croatia ^_^
	<andrew____>	did you change the name to avoid confusion?
	<pygi>	andrew____, if you are interested ofcourse :)
	<andrew____>	i don't know what you mean pygi, how could you help me?
	<pygi>	andrew____, partly, but it's also bad to hat the top hat and library same name :)
	<pygi>	andrew____, we'll talk over mail :)
	<pygi>	andrew____, what's wrong with me trying to help you make a webpage? xD
	<andrew____>	nothing at all, just that you need to know how the library works and i'm assuming you don't
	<andrew____>	pygi: did you say libburn was added to fedora?
	<pygi>	andrew____, I read the source you know, but nevermind:)
	<pygi>	andrew____, yesh, why?
	<pygi>	andrew____, 0.3.0 will get in fedora soon
	<andrew____>	iso master just got sponsored so it's getting added too.
	<pygi>	andrew____, congrats ^_^
	<andrew____>	thanks
	<pygi>	that means bkisofs as well?
	<andrew____>	no, it's not a separate entity until it has documentation and a separate download link at least
	<pygi>	oh
	<pygi>	may I suggest you split it as soon as you can? :)
	<pygi>	phoenix24, got the idea at least? :)
	<andrew____>	yeah like i said i just have to get off my ass and do it
	<pygi>	andrew____, same with documenting the source
	* pygi	hides
	<phoenix24>	pygi: yesh.. :)
	<andrew____>	ihave no plans to document the source, it changes too often
	<pygi>	andrew____, make a stable api with 1.0
	<pygi>	andrew____, it just has to be done
	<pygi>	and start 1.5.x series
	<pygi>	phoenix24, more questions? ^_^
	<phoenix24>	pygi: yeah .. few.
	<pygi>	phoenix24, I'm all ears :)
	<andrew____>	true, but the stable api requires support for soft and hard links, which is a lot of effort. not even mkisofs supports links properly.
	<pygi>	andrew____, don't compare with mkisofs ^_^
	<pygi>	but I understand
	<andrew____>	hehe
	<andrew____>	why, have you run into jorg in the past?
	<pygi>	andrew____, no, I talk with joerg regulary :)
	<pygi>	We post bug reports, talk with him, and solve issues :)
	<andrew____>	is he considering using libburn in cdrecord?
	<andrew____>	would be neat if he did
	<pygi>	andrew____, no, lol :)
	<pygi>	but he'll adapt,he has to
	<pygi>	we introduced -tao on dvd
	<pygi>	neither cdrecord or wodim have it
	<andrew____>	hey you ought to know this: is it possible to blank a dvd like you do a blank=fast for a cd?
	<andrew____>	i'm writing a software using wodim to burn cds/dvds
	<andrew____>	for a freedom toaster
	<pygi>	oh, wodim :-d
	<andrew____>	what? it works better than cdrecord
	<pygi>	I didn't say nothing :)
	<andrew____>	can libburn do it?
	<pygi>	we just introduced support for dvd+rw and dvd-rw, and we can ofcourse format the dvd's :)
	<andrew____>	not format, just a fast blank on rw media?
	* pygi	thinks
	<pygi>	lemme try to remember, 5 in the morning it is :)
	<andrew____>	it's not important
	<pygi>	it is, wait :)
	<andrew____>	i can do without blanking, it's not unreasonable to require the user to have a blank disk
	<andrew____>	i'm doing it in python anyway, you probably don't have python wrappers
	<pygi>	no, no python bindings for now, sorry
	<andrew____>	actually the neatest part of this project is the hardware :) take a look if you're interested (we just got started) http://cdot.senecac.on.ca/projects/toaster/history/
	* pygi	clicks
	<pygi>	hehe :)
	<andrew____>	we're gonna put it in the school for everyone to use
	<pygi>	nice :)
	<andrew____>	anyway, i have to go back to work. good luck with everything
