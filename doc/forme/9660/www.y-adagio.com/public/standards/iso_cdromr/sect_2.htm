<h4>
6.1 Arrangement of data on a CD-ROM
</h4>
<h4>
6.1.1 Physical Addresses
</h4>
<p>
Each sector shall be identified by a unique Physical Address as specified in the relevant ISO/IEC 10149.
<h4>
6.1.2 Logical Sector
</h4>
<p>
The sectors of a volume shall be organized into Logical Sectors. Each Logical Sector shall consist of a number of bytes equal to 2 048 or 2<span class=super>n</span>, whichever is larger, where n is the largest integer such that 2<span class=super>n</span> is less than, or equal to, the number of bytes in the Data Field of any sector recorded on the volume. The number of bytes in a Logical Sector shall be referred to as the Logical Sector Size. Each Logical Sector shall begin in a different sector from any other Logical Sector, and shall begin with the first byte of the Data Field of the sector in which it begins. If the number of bytes of the Data Field of each sector recorded on the volume is less than 2 048, a Logical Sector shall comprise more than one sector, and the set of the Physical Addresses of its constituent sectors shall form a consecutive ascending sequence. The data of a Logical Sector shall be recorded in the Data Fields of its constituent sectors.
<p>
Each Logical Sector shall be identified by a unique Logical Sector Number. Logical Sector Numbers shall be integers assigned in an ascending sequence, in order of ascending Physical Addresses of the constituent sectors, starting with O for the Logical Sector containing the sector having the lowest Physical Address which may contain recorded information. The numbering shall continue through successive Logical Sectors, each of which begins with the sector with the next higher Physical Address than that of the last sector constituting the previous Logical Sector.
<h4>
6.1.3 Volume Space
</h4>
<p>
The information on a volume shall be recorded in the set of all Logical Sectors on the volume. This set shall be referred to as the Volume Space of the volume.
<p>
The bytes in the Volume Space shall be numbered consecutively. The numbering shall start with 1, which shall be assigned to the first byte of the first Logical Sector of the Volume Space. The numbering shall continue through successive bytes of the first Logical Sector, and then through successive bytes of each successive Logical Sector, of the Volume Space.
<h4>

<p>
The Data Area shall occupy the remaining Logical Sectors of the Volume Space.
<h4>
6.2.2 Logical Block
</h4>
<p>
The Volume Space shall be organized into Logical Blocks. Each Logical Block shall consist of 2n+9 bytes, where n equals O or a positive integer. The number of bytes in a Logical Block shall be referred to as the Logical Block Size which shall not be greater than the Logical Sector Size.
<p>
Each Logical Block shall be identified by a unique Logical Block Number. Logical Block Numbers shall be integers assigned in ascending order starting with O. Logical Block Number O shall be assigned to the Logical Block which begins with the first byte of the Volume Space.

<li>Volume Descriptors
<li>File Descriptors
<li>Directory Descriptors
<li>Path Tables
</ul>
<p>
The Volume Descriptors shall be recorded in consecutively numbered Logical Sectors starting with the Logical Sector having Logical Sector Number 16. The Logical Sectors in the Data Area shall be available for the assignment of Volume Partitions and the recording of File Sections, File Descriptors, Directory Descriptors and Path Tables.
<p>
Each File Section shall be recorded in an Extent, and shall be identified by a descriptor in a directory. An Extended Attribute Record can be associated with the File Section. If present, it shall be recorded in the same Extent as the associated File Section, and shall be identified by the descriptor that identifies the associated File Section. Each directory shall be recorded as a file in a single Extent, and shall be identified by a Directory Descriptor either in another directory or in a Volume Descriptor. Each directory shall also be identified by a record in a Path Table. Each Path Table shall be identified in a Volume Descriptor.

<h4>
9.1.7 File Unit Size (BP 27)
</h4>
<p>
This field shall contain an 8-bit number. This number shall specify the File Unit Size for the File Section if the File Section is recorded in interleaved mode. Otherwise this number shall be zero.
<p>
This field shall be recorded according to 7.1.1.
<h4>
9.1.8 Interleave Gap Size (BP 28)
</h4>
<p>
This field shall contain an 8-bit number. This number shall specify the Interleave Gap Size for File Section if the File Section is recorded in interleaved mode. Otherwise this number shall be zero.
<p>
This field shall be recorded according to 7.1.1.
<h4>
9.1.9 Volume Sequence Number (BP 29 to 32)
</h4>
<p>
This field shall specify as a 16-bit number the ordinal number of the volume in the Volume Set on which  the Extent described by this Directory Record is recorded.
<p>
This field shall be recorded according to 7.2.3.
<h4>
9.1.10 Length of File Identifier (LEN_FI) (BP 33)
</h4>
<p>
This field shall specify as an 8-bit number the length in bytes of the File Identifier field of the Directory Record.
<p>
This field shall be recorded according to 7.1.1.
<h4>
9.1.11 File Identifier [BP 34 to (33+LEN_FI)]
</h4>
<p>
The interpretation of this field depends as follows on the setting of the Directory bit of the File Flags field.
<p>
If set to ZERO, shall mean:
<ul>
<li>The field shall specify an identification for the file.
<li>The characters in this field shall be d-characters or d1-characters, SEPARATOR 1, SEPARATOR 2.
<li>The field shall be recorded as specified in 7.5.
</ul>
<p>
If set to ONE, shall mean:
<ul>
<li>The field shall specify an identification for the directory.
<li>The characters in this field shall be d-characters or d1-characters, or only a (OO) byte, or only a (O1) byte.
<li>The field shall be recorded as specified in 7.6.
</ul>
<h4>
9.1.12 Padding Field [BP (34+LEN_FI)]
</h4>
<p>
This field shall be present in the Directory Record only if the number in the Length of the File Identifier field is an even number.
<p>
If present, this Field shall be set to (OO).
<h4>
9.1.13 System Use [BP (LEN_DR-LEN_SU+1) to LEN_DR]
</h4>
<p>
This field shall be optional. If present, this field shall be reserved for system use. Its content is not specified by this International Standard. If necessary, so that the Directory Record comprises an even number of bytes, a (OO) byte shall be added to terminate this field.
<h4>
9.2 Consistency of File Attributes between Directory Records of a File
</h4>
<p>
The following fields of each Directory Record for the same file shall contain the same values:
<ul>
<li>Existence bit of the File Flags field;
<li>Directory bit of the File Flags Field;
<li>Associated File bit of the File Flags Field;
<li>Record bit of the File Flags field;
<li>Reserved bits of the File Flags field;
<li>Length of File Identifier field;
<li>File Identifier field;
<li>Padding field.
</ul>
<h4>
9.3 Order of Directory Records
</h4>
<p>
The records of a Directory shall be ordered according to the relative value of the File Identifier field by the following criteria in descending order of significance:
<p>
a) in ascending order according to the relative value of File Name, where File Names shall be valued as follows:
<ul>
<li>If two File Names have the same content in all byte positions, then these two File Names are said to be equal in value.
<li>if two File Names do not contain the same number of byte positions, the shorter File Name shall be treated as if it were padded on the right with all padding bytes set to FILLER and as if both File Names contained the identical number of byte positions.
<li>After any padding necessary to treat the File Names as if they were of equal length, the characters in the corresponding byte positions, starting with the first position, of the File Names are compared until a byte position is found that does not contain the same character in both File Names. The greater File Name is the one that contains the character with the higher code position value in the coded graphic character set used to interpret the File Identifier field of the Directory Record.
</ul>
<p>
b) in ascending order according to the relative value File Name Extensions, where File Name Extensions shall be valued as follows:
<ul>
<li>If two File Name Extensions have the same content in all byte positions, then these two File Name Extensions are said to be equal in value.
<li>If two File Name Extensions do not contain the same number of byte positions, the shorter File Name Extension shall be treated as if it were padded on the right with all padding bytes set to FILLER and as if both File Name Extensions contained the identical number of byte positions.
