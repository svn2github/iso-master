<p>
<b>12.3.3</b> The implementation shall allow the data preparer to supply the information that is to be recorded in the descriptor fields listed below, and shall not record the Volume Partition Descriptor if the data preparer does not supply the information.
<p>
For each Volume Partition Descriptor:
<ul>
<li>System Identifier
<li>Volume Partition Identifier
<li>Volume Partition Location

</ul>
<p>
<b>12.3.4</b> The implementation shall allow the data preparer to supply the information that is to be recorded in the descriptor fields listed below, and shall not record the Boot Record if the data preparer does not supply the information.
<p>
For each Boot Record:
<ul>
<li>Boot System Identifier
<li>Boot Identifier
<li>Boot System Use
</ul>
<p>
<b>12.3.5</b> The implementation shall allow the data preparer to supply the information that is to be recorded in the descriptor fields listed below, and need not record the Extended Attribute Record if the data preparer does not supply the information for any of the descriptor fields listed below. If the Extended Attribute Record is recorded, the implementation shall supply the information for a field if the data preparer dose not supply it.
<p>
For each Extended Attribute Record:

<h4>
12.4 System Area
</h4>
<p>
The implementation shall allow the data preparer to supply the information that is to be recorded on the Logical Sectors with Logical Sector Numbers 0 to 15.

<h3><a name=cls_13>
13 Requirements for a receiving system
</a></h3>
<h4>
13.1 General
</h4>
<p>
The implementation shall be capable of reading the files and the recorded descriptors from a Volume Set that has been recorded in accordance with one of the interchange levels specified in this International Standard, except Associated Files.
<h4>
13.2 Files
</h4>
<p>
The implementation shall make available to the user the information that constitutes the recorded files, except any Associated File.
<p>
If the implementation allows the user to specify that the information constituting a file is to be interpreted according to 6.10, the implementation shall make available to the user the length of each record in the file.
<h4>
13.3 Descriptors
</h4>
<p>
<b>13.3.1</b> The implementation shall allow the user to supply information sufficient to enable the implementation to locate the files required by the user, and to locate the volumes on which these are recorded.
<p>
<b>13.3.2</b> The implementation shall make available to the user the information that is recorded in each of the descriptor fields listed below.
<p>
For the Primary Volume Descriptor:
<ul>
<li>Volume Identifier
<li>Volume Set Identifier
<li>Copyright File Identifier
<li>Abstract File Identifier
<li>Bibliographic File Identifier
</ul>
<p>

</ul>
<h4>
13.4 Restrictions
</h4>
<p>
The implementation may impose a limit on the length of a record to be made available to be user. The implementation is not required to make available to the user any byte beyond the first n bytes of a record, where n is the value of the imposed limit.
<h4>
13.5 Levels of Implementation
</h4>
<p>
This International Standard specifies two nested levels of implementation.
<h4>
13.5.1 Level 1
</h4>
<p>
At Level 1 the implementation is permitted not to make available to the user:
<ul>
<li>the information that constitutes the files identified in a Directory Hierarchy that is identified in a Supplementary Volume Descriptor or in an Enhanced Volume Descriptor;
<li>the information that is recorded in the descriptor fields of a Supplementary Volume Descriptor or the descriptor fields of an Enhanced Volume Descriptor and of the associated Path Table Records, associated Directory Records, and Extended Attribute Records identified by the associated Directory Records.
</ul>
<h4>
13.5.2 Level 2
</h4>
<p>
At Level 2 no such restrictions shall apply.
