ui:
-alt shortcut keys need attention (bulgarian)
-sometimes the help window won't come up in the middle of the main window
-delete key should work
-change file/dir properties (especialy creation date)
-add save/overwrite #undef-ed by default
-allow editing address on iso bar


bk:
-dos doesn't like names to start with underscores
-add path tables, boot record to size estimate
-split bk_write_image()
-writeElToritoBootCatalog(), writeElToritoVd() cast return to int, no good
-bootRecordSize?, bootRecordOffset should be off_t
-change 8.3 filenames to 32 (to support some more bootable cds)


c99 compatibility issues:
-localtime_r() - implicit declaration
-strdup() - implicit declaration
-lstat() - implicit declaration and some mess with st_size


tests to run before a release:
- open iso from command-line
- create blank, see if it mounts (try norock, nojoliet)
- make a bootable windows (also add, delete some files)
 - see if it mounts (try norock, nojoliet)
 - see if it boots
- edit a linux disk and save without rock, without joliet, without any
- make a dos bootable cd, see if it boots
 - from scratch
 - starting with an existing no emulation bootable disk
- delete config file, make sure it still works

- update changelog.txt
- update credits and credits.txt
- cd isomaster; svn export src releases/isomaster-version
