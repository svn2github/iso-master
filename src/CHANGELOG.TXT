=================
- Can now read and write no-emulation and floppy-emulation boot records.
- Fixed bug where deleting the directory last viewed in the filesystem browser would cause strange things to happen.
- Improved 9660 name mangling to only include the ~xxxx hash in case of conflicts, also significantly increased the number of times to try to remangle a name before giving up.
- Can now create new directories both on the image and the filesystem.
- Added fields to show location (path) on the image and the filesystem.
- Added option to show hidden files on the filesystem.
- Fixed bug where having a large directory tree would cause a corrupt path table.
- Other small but technically interesting changes, see svn log r118-r126

=================
- Default is now to not keep the permissions from rockridge as some cds have 
  directories with no write permissions and that makes them hard to write to.
- Added application icon, got it from 
  http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Gallery
- Added case insensitive *.ISO mask to file open/save dialogs
- Can now remember window size, pane height and last fs directory visited, 
  all stored in ~/.isomaster, config file parser/writer from 
  http://ndevilla.free.fr/iniparser/
- Can now create new image from scratch.
