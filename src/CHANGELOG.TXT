30 Oct 2006 - 0.5
=================
- If only one file in a directory fails to add or extract, added a callback in bk and a dialog window in the GUI to allow the user to ignore that error.
- Moved some structures away from bk.h (they weren't for public use).
- Added keyboard shortcuts for new, open, save and quit.
- Moved the responsibility for opening the iso file (for reading or writing) from the user to bk.
- Added option (enabled by default) to sort directories first.
- Added window to allow to set the disk label, publisher and the filename types for the new image.
- Fixed bug that cause newly created images to have broken permissions (RockRidge) on the root directory.
- Saving an iso now compares the inode of the new image with the old one rather than the name, so overwriting should not be possible now under any circumstnces.
- Size is now stored in a 64bit size_t o avoid warnings and errors with the file browser looking at files > 4G.
- Create new directory window now checks for blank filename, bk now refuses to accept a blank name new directory request.
- Can now have an iso file as a command-line parameter, so can open iso files in ISO Master using a file manager.

=================
- Fixed a bug that caused a segmentation fault when starting to save the image.
- Minor improvement to the makefile to facilitate customising.

- Can now read and write no-emulation and floppy-emulation boot records.

- Added fields to show location (path) on the image and the filesystem.
- Added option to show hidden files on the filesystem.

- Other small but technically interesting changes, see svn log r118-r126

26 Aug 2006 - 0.2
=================
- Default is now to not keep the permissions from rockridge as some cds have 
  directories with no write permissions and that makes them hard to write to.

  http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Gallery
- Added case insensitive *.ISO mask to file open/save dialogs
- Can now remember window size, pane height and last fs directory visited,
