- Default is now to not keep the permissions from rockridge as some cds have directories with no write permissions and that makes them hard to write to.
- Added application icon, got it from http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Gallery
- Added case insensitive *.ISO mask to file open/save dialogs
- Can now remember window size, pane height and last fs directory visited, all stored in ~/.isomaster, config file parser/writer from http://ndevilla.free.fr/iniparser/
