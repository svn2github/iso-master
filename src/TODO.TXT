ui:
-drop-down list to select track - can do multitrack
-checkboxes and lables not aligned in change permissions window
-other gtk apps on windows: gimp, pidgin, inkscape
-add 'case-sensitive sort' view option


bk:
-dos doesn't like names to start with underscores
-add path tables, boot record to size estimate
-need a bk_set_warning_foo()
-using access() to check whether a file exists is no good, target of a dead symlink will get written
-fedora7 dvd takes forever to remangle. try either fix the algorithm or allow longer 9660 names.
-sorting 9660/joliet can also be slow
-look for !!, there are some new ones


windows port:
-check about box. file bug?
-find an installer

manual:
-add_as() and extract_as()
-get_ and set_permissions()
-bk_set_publisher() and bk_set_vol_name() now return int


c99 compatibility issues:
-localtime_r() - implicit declaration
-strdup() - implicit declaration
-lstat() - implicit declaration and some mess with st_size
-try to make sure icons are loaded relative to the isomaster dir


tests to run before a release:
- make an iso with some 3G files in it, open it, save it, make sure the files are not corrupted
- open iso from command-line
- create blank, see if it mounts (try norock, nojoliet)
- make a bootable windows (also add, delete some files)
 - see if it mounts (try norock, nojoliet)
 - see if it boots
- edit a linux disk and save without rock, without joliet, without any
- make a dos bootable cd, see if it boots
 - from scratch
 - starting with an existing no emulation bootable disk
- delete config file, make sure it still works
- add a bunch of files to an iso, delete all the files, add some more, save
- edit some text and binary files, make sure they extract and write properly
- add a 3 gig file, make sure image saves and can extract it afterwords

to make a fedora package:
- install rpmdevtools (via yum)
- fedora-buildrpmtree (as *your* user)
- Check if there is a file ~/.rpmmacros (if not create it).
- Make sure there is a line:
 - %dist   .fc7
- Download my SRPMS [1] to ~/rpmbuild/SRPMS
- Call: rpmbuild --rebuild isomaster-1.0-1.src.rpm
- Wait a moment and look for a built RPM in ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/i386
