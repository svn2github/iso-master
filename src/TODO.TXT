ui:
-drop-down list to select track - can do multitrack
-show exec failed warnings from editor.c
-checkboxes and lables not aligned in change permissions window
-log bug 'file size not updated after editing a file'


bk:
-dos doesn't like names to start with underscores
-add path tables, boot record to size estimate
-need a bk_set_warning_foo()
-using access() to check whether a file exists is no good, target of a dead symlink will get overwritten
-fedora7 takes forever to remangle. try either fix the algorithm or allow longer 9660 names.


manual:
-add_as() and extract_as()
-get_ and set_permissions()
-bk_set_publisher() and bk_set_vol_name() now return int


c99 compatibility issues:
-localtime_r() - implicit declaration
-strdup() - implicit declaration
-lstat() - implicit declaration and some mess with st_size


tests to run before a release:
- open iso from command-line
- create blank, see if it mounts (try norock, nojoliet)
- make a bootable windows (also add, delete some files)
 - see if it mounts (try norock, nojoliet)
 - see if it boots
- edit a linux disk and save without rock, without joliet, without any
- make a dos bootable cd, see if it boots
 - from scratch
 - starting with an existing no emulation bootable disk
- delete config file, make sure it still works
- add a bunch of files to an iso, delete all the files, add some more, save
- edit some text and binary files, make sure they extract and write properly

to make a fedora package:
- install rpmdevtools (via yum)
- fedora-buildrpmtree (as *your* user)
- Check if there is a file ~/.rpmmacros (if not create it).
- Make sure there is a line:
 - %dist   .fc7
- Download my SRPMS [1] to ~/rpmbuild/SRPMS
- Call: rpmbuild --rebuild isomaster-1.0-1.src.rpm
- Wait a moment and look for a built RPM in ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/i386

to package a release:
- update the version number in the about box
- update version in man page
- remove -g and -DDEBUG from Makefile and bk/Makefile
- update changelog.txt
- update credits and credits.txt
- check readme.txt
- cd isomaster && svn export src releases/isomaster-version
- delete icons/originals
- tar cvjf isomaster-version.tar.bz2 isomaster-version/
