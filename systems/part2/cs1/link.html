For Linux users who need to view, extract or modify the contents of CD images, ISO Master is an ISO editor that will allow users to perform their task quickly. Unlike the currently used application our product will provide a graphical user interface to minimize the time required to view, extract or modify the contents of CD images and will eliminate the current requirement of learning the details of storage on a CD.
