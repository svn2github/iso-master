To run the test, you must use a remote terminal application such as telnet or putty to connect 
to the cs1 server. These instructions assume you will be using the telnet client that comes 
with every windows machine.

Under the start menu there is an item called 'Run', click that.

Type this into the box and click ok:
  telnet cs1.senecac.on.ca

It will prompt for a username (use b5301a07) and password (use 05343521).

The following command will run the test:
 ./testread2 slackd1-head.iso | less

You may use the pageUp and pageDown keys to scroll the list. When finished, press the letter 
'q' to quit the test and type exit to close the session.

The contents of list of files and directories displayed will match the list posted on the 
website. I have very little control over the linux 'ls' command that was used to generate the 
static list so the order of elements is not very straight-forward. For example:
 - the 'ls' command mixes files and directories based on alphabetical order
 - the 'ls' command shows all contents of a directory first and then the contents of every 
subdirectory while my program shows the contents of each (sub)directory as it is encountered

If comparing the results is too difficult using a text file, I can provide a copy of the CD and you can use Windows 
Explorer to view it's contents.
