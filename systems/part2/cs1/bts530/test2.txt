Download isomuster.tar.gz to a linux machine (will not work on windows). Can be done using remote shell on matrix since no gui is being used.

Extract it: tar xvzf isomuster.tar.gz

Enter the directory: cd isomuster

Compile library and test: make unittest

Run test: ./unittest

If any test fails, it will not say 'OK!' in the end.
